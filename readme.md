## NodeMCU v3 Roomy Case with Ventilated Sensor Bay

A spacious case for the NodeMCU v3 made in openSCAD. Has enough room to hold the board, plug in dupont connectors, and route the connectors to a ventilated sensor bay (eg for temperature sensor). 


#### Note: Not a snug fit! The NodeMCU will likely fall off the supports without tape or the tension of the dupont connectors to hold it in place.




I made this case so that I could use NodeMCU v3 boards that I had as part of a wifi MQTT temperature reporting system without desoldering the DuPont connectors. Using DuPont connectors requires a few centimetres of clearance from the PCB, and the temperature sensors need to be a good distance away from the board to avoid being heated, so the case is quite bulky.
